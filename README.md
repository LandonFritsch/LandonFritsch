# Hi, I’m Landon Fritsch 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at Indiana University Bloomington (graduating May 2026) with a strong interest in building real-world software systems and products. I actively create and explore projects driven by curiosity and enjoyment, with a particular passion for **sports** and technology. I’m currently **open to work** and seeking software engineering opportunities across backend, full-stack, and product-focused roles.
