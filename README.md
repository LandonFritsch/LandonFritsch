# Hi, I’m Landon Fritsch 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at Indiana University Bloomington graduating in May 2026, focused on building practical, real-world software systems. I’m especially interested in backend development, mobile applications, and designing clean, maintainable code.

I enjoy working on projects that involve real data, clear architecture, and solving problems end-to-end — from design to implementation.
